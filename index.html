<h2>
<a name="what-is-diffscuss" class="anchor" href="#what-is-diffscuss"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Diffscuss?</h2>

<p>Diffscuss is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a file format, built on the the unified diff format, that allows
threaded code reviews to exist inline with the diffs they address</p></li>
<li><p>an Emacs mode and Vim plugin to support responding to / managing
code reviews in that format (including jumping directly to the
source code a comment addresses)</p></li>
<li><p>a set of command line tools to support generating and managing
reviews in the diffscuss format with a simple, directory based tool
for posting and managing code reviews</p></li>
</ul><p>We at Hut 8 Labs originally developed diffscuss to help us do code
reviews when we were onsite with a client who didn't have their own
code review system.  We found ourselves emailing diffs back and forth,
writing things like "about halfway through the diff you do X, maybe
you should do Y?"  Eventually we started writing comments right in the
diffs themselves, with markers like "EWJ REVIEW!!!" and thought "There
has to be a better way."</p>

<p>Now, about 6 months into using diffscuss, we've grown to love its
support for code reviews in our editors--where we're already efficient
at reading and navigating code--and especially its abililty to jump
directly from a comment to the corresponding line of actual source,
which lowers the activation energy for addressing reviews and actually
making all those little suggested improvements.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you like the idea of reading and responding to code reviews right in
your editor</p></li>
<li><p>you want to lower the activation energy needed to apply small fixes
and suggestions (jump right to the source with a single key combo!
make the change!  jump right back!)</p></li>
<li><p>you like the idea of keeping your reviews in your repo, right next
to your code, or emailing them back and forth if you're just a
couple hackers working on something and that's easier</p></li>
<li><p>you like the idea of using grep and all the rest of that unix-y
toolchain goodness on your reviews</p></li>

<a name="why-shouldnt-you-use-diffscuss" class="anchor" href="#why-shouldnt-you-use-diffscuss"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Shouldn't You Use Diffscuss?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>you're a big team, or you have significant process around code
reviews (e.g. you have automated restrictions for review-then-commit
workflows)</p></li>
<li><p>you're not using git (for the moment, diffscuss is tightly
integrated with git)</p></li>
<li><p>you're not using Emacs or Vim (for the moment, those are the two
editors with diffscuss tooling support)</p></li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>
<a name="install-the-diffscuss-exe" class="anchor" href="#install-the-diffscuss-exe"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install the diffscuss exe</h3>

<p>Diffscuss is a set of python utils wrapped in a single exe.  You can
either get the latest source from github and run run <code>setup.py
install</code>, or you can grab the latest release from pypi with
<code>easy_install diffscuss</code> or <code>pip install diffscuss</code>.</p>

<h3>
<a name="install-the-emacs-mode-or-vim-plugin" class="anchor" href="#install-the-emacs-mode-or-vim-plugin"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install the Emacs mode or Vim plugin</h3>

<p>(see "The Emacs Mode" and "The Vim Plugin" below for installation and
usage)</p>

<p>You can now go bare bolts and just open up any unified diff file to
start reviewing, or you can...</p>

<h3>
<a name="generate-a-diffscuss-review" class="anchor" href="#generate-a-diffscuss-review"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Generate a diffscuss review.</h3>

<p>Use <code>diffscuss generate</code> from within a git repo to generate a new
review.  The only required argument is the revision range to construct
the review from, which is passed through as is to git and can
therefore be in any format recognized by git log
(e.g. <code>HEAD^..HEAD</code> is a common one).</p>

<p>By default all the commit messages within the range will be collected
into the initial review comment, and the author will be the value of
the <code>user.name</code> git config setting.</p>

<h3>
<a name="set-up-simple-code-review-management" class="anchor" href="#set-up-simple-code-review-management"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Set up simple code review management</h3>

<p>Diffscuss supports an extremely basic per-user "inbox" for incoming
code reviews.</p>

<p>These inbox are just directories, and reviews are "added to" an inbox
by creating a symbolic link to a diffscuss file (which is kept in a
per-repo "diffscussions" directory).</p>

<p>To get started, run <code>diffscuss mailbox init</code> (or run with -h to
see help).  This will create (by default) a .diffscuss-mb file and a
"diffscussions" directory at the top level of your repo, both of which
should be added to source control.</p>

<p>Next you'll want to create an inbox per user, with <code>diffscuss
mailbox make-inbox &lt;user-name&gt;</code>, which will create an inbox under
"diffscussions/users/".</p>

<p>Finally, so that you can check your inbox for new reviews, you'll want
to tell diffscuss which inbox should be considered yours by running
<code>diffscuss mailbox set-default-inbox &lt;your-user-name&gt;</code>.  This
creates a config variable called diffscuss-mb.inbox in your local git
config and sets it to the user name you supplied.</p>

<h3>
<a name="use-simple-code-review-management" class="anchor" href="#use-simple-code-review-management"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use simple code review management</h3>

<p>Under <code>diffscuss mailbox</code> There is support for posting reviews,
marking them done (which just translates to removing symlinks in user
directories), and "bouncing" reviews, which means marking your review
done and asking someone else to take a look (e.g., because you made
comments that you want the original poster to implement / respond to).</p>

<p>Use <code>diffscuss mailbox -h</code> and <code>diffscuss mailbox &lt;subcommand&gt;
-h</code> for arguments and options to run from the command line.</p>

<p>The Emacs and Vim modes also have support for checking your mailbox,
posting, bouncing, and marking reviews done right from your editor.</p>

<p>In Emacs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>C-c m p</code> prompts for recipients and posts the current Diffscuss
file for their review</p></li>
<li><p><code>C-c m b</code> prompts for recipients and bounces the review to them,
removing the review from your inbox.</p></li>
<li><p><code>C-c m d</code> marks the review as done, removing it from your inbox.</p></li>
<li><p><code>M-x diffscuss-mb-check</code> checks your inbox and lists all
incoming reviews.  You may wish to bind it globally to <code>C-c m c</code>
with:</p></li>
</ul><pre><code>(global-set-key "\C-cmc"  'diffscuss-mb-check)
</code></pre>

<p>In Vim:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>&lt;leader&gt;mp</code> prompts for recipients and posts the current Diffscuss
file for their review</p></li>
<li><p><code>&lt;leader&gt;mb</code> prompts for recipients and bounces the review to them,
removing the review from your inbox.</p></li>
<li><p><code>&lt;leader&gt;md</code> marks the review as done, removing it from your inbox.</p></li>
<li><p><code>&lt;leader&gt;mc</code> opens a preview window with a list of all incoming
reviews in your inbox. You can use <code>gf</code> with your cursor on a
filename in the list to open the review (or e.g. <code>C-w gf</code> to open it
in a new tab).</p></li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="getting-help" class="anchor" href="#getting-help"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting help</h2>

<p>The diffscuss exe has help available with -h globally and for each
subcommand.</p>

<h2>
<a name="the-format-in-a-nutshell" class="anchor" href="#the-format-in-a-nutshell"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Format in a Nutshell</h2>

<p>Diffscuss adds a single beginning-of-line character to the unified
diff format: %, which marks the beginning of a comment line.  Lines
beginning with %* are comment headers, and lines beginning with %- are
comment bodies.  The number of * or - characters indicates reply
threading.</p>

<p>Comments apply to the line directly above them.  Comments at the top
of the file apply to the entire review in general.</p>

<p>Take a look at the "Format Definition" section for (much) more detail.</p>

<h2>
<a name="the-emacs-mode" class="anchor" href="#the-emacs-mode"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Emacs Mode</h2>

<p>The Emacs mode is implemented in a single .el file, diffscuss-mode.el.
To install, either move the diffscuss-mode.el file to a directory in
your load path or else add the Diffscuss mode directory to your load
path in your .emacs file like so:</p>

<pre><code>(setq load-path
      (append (list nil "/path/to/diffscuss/diffscuss-mode")
               load-path))
</code></pre>

<p>Once the file is in your load path, require the mode with:</p>

<pre><code>(require 'diffscuss-mode)
</code></pre>

<p>The mode colorizes Diffscuss files to make for easier reading.  In
addition it helps with:</p>

<h3>
<a name="inserting-comments" class="anchor" href="#inserting-comments"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inserting Comments</h3>

<p>The main command you need to know is <code>C-c C-c</code>, which generally
"does the right thing" based on the position of the cursor.  To wit:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the cursor is at the very top of the buffer, it will insert a new
review-level comment (this function is available anywhere in the
buffer with <code>C-c C-f</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>If the cursor is inside another comment, it will create a reply to
that comment (this can also be invoked with <code>C-c C-r</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>If the cursor is inside the diff index information for a file /
hunk, it will insert a comment after the "range line" (the line
beginning with @@).</p></li>
<li><p>If the cursor is on a diff line, it will create a comment directly
below that line (this is also available with <code>C-c C-i</code>).</p></li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="jumping-to-source" class="anchor" href="#jumping-to-source"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Jumping to Source</h3>

<p>This currently requires that the Diffscuss file you are visiting is
somewhere under a git checkout of the repo against which the Diffscuss
file was generated.</p>

<h4>
<a name="local-source" class="anchor" href="#local-source"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Local Source</h4>

<p>If you position the cursor on one of the diff lines in a Diffscuss
file, then:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>C-c s</code> will attempt to find the local source file / line in
that file that's the best candidate to match up with the Diffscuss
line the cursor is currently on.</li>
</ul><h4>
<a name="repository-versions-of-the-source" class="anchor" href="#repository-versions-of-the-source"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Repository Versions of the Source</h4>

<ul>
<li><p><code>C-c -</code> will open up a temporary buffer containing the old
version of the source (if it's available locally), with the cursor
positioned on the same line.</p></li>
<li><p><code>C-c +</code> will open up a temporary buffer containing the new
version of the source (if it's available locally), with the cursor
positioned on the same line.</p></li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="navigation" class="anchor" href="#navigation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Navigation</h3>

<p>You can move around the Diffscussion quickly using:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>C-c f</code> to move forward one comment.</p></li>
<li><p><code>C-c b</code> to move back one comment.</p></li>
<li><p><code>C-c n</code> to move to the next thread.</p></li>
<li><p><code>C-c p</code> to move to the previous thread.</p></li>
<li><p><code>C-c a</code> to move to the beginning of the current thread.</p></li>
<li><p><code>C-c e</code> to move to the end of the current thread.</p></li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="the-vim-plugin" class="anchor" href="#the-vim-plugin"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Vim Plugin</h2>

<p>Like the Emacs mode, the Vim plugin offers syntax highlighting, comment insertion,
commands for jumping to source files, and motions for comments and threads.
The Vim plugin is implemented primarily in Python, so you'll need a version of
Vim compiled with Python support in order to use it
(<code>vim --version | grep '+python'</code>).</p>

<li>Copy <code>diffscuss/diffscuss.vim</code> to <code>~/.vim/bundle</code>.</li>
<li>Set the <code>diffscuss_dir</code> key of <code>g:diffscuss_config</code> to the path of the
<code>diffscuss</code> clone.</li>
</ol><h3>
<a name="configuration" class="anchor" href="#configuration"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuration</h3>

<p>The Vim plugin will use its environment and <code>git config</code> to determine your name
and email (for pre-filling comments) and for various runtime paths.</p>

<p>If you wish, you can override these settings by specifying some or all of a
<code>g:diffscuss_config</code> dictionary in your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<a name="pull-request-export-experimental" class="anchor" href="#pull-request-export-experimental"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pull Request Export (Experimental)</h2>

<p>Diffscuss ships with an experimental <code>diffscuss github-import</code>
command, which imports or more Github pull requests into local
Diffscuss files.</p>

<p>One possible use for this (besides transition, if you're going to use
Diffscuss), is to provide a searchable, offline copy of your pull
requests.</p>

<p>There's some talk about making this bidirectional, so that, e.g., you
could import a pull request, make local responses in diffscuss, and
push the changes, but for the moment it's just talk.  Let us know if
you'd be interested in this (or interested in helping write it!).</p>

<a name="format-definition-in-hairy-detail" class="anchor" href="#format-definition-in-hairy-detail"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Format Definition in Hairy Detail</h2>

<h3>
<a name="beginning-of-line-marker" class="anchor" href="#beginning-of-line-marker"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Beginning of Line Marker</h3>

<p>All Diffscuss lines begin with one '%'.</p>

<p>There's no limit to the length of a Diffscuss line, but keeping them
80 chars or less when possible is probably good citizenship, since
they're meant to be read and edited inside editors.</p>

<h3>
<a name="diffscuss-comment-format" class="anchor" href="#diffscuss-comment-format"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Diffscuss Comment Format</h3>

<p>A Diffscuss comment begins with an author line, and possibly other
header lines, followed by at least one body line.</p>

<h3>
<a name="header-lines" class="anchor" href="#header-lines"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Header Lines</h3>

<p>A header line one '%' followed by at least one '*', followed by a
space, followed by a header of the format 'field-name: value'.</p>

<p>Header lines may also be empty, containing no 'field-name: value', in
which case the space after the * is also optional.</p>

<p>A header line must always begin a comment or follow another header
line.</p>

<p>For example, all three of these are valid header lines:</p>

<pre><code>%* author: Bob Jones
</code></pre>

<pre><code>%**
</code></pre>

<pre><code>%*** x-github-version: 1
</code></pre>

<p>The field name cannot contain whitespace.  The value cannot contain a
newline.</p>

<p>The current Diffscuss headers are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>author</p></li>
<li><p>email</p></li>
<li><p>date</p></li>
</ul><p>Non-standard headers should begin with an 'x-', to keep compatible
with future additions to the Diffscuss format (for example, this is
what the github import uses).</p>

<h4>
<a name="the-author-header" class="anchor" href="#the-author-header"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The author Header</h4>

<p>An author line is a standard header line with a field of 'author' and
a value indicating who authored the comment.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>%* author: ejorgensen
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>%** author: bsmith
</code></pre>

<p>Every comment must begin with an author line.  All other headers are
optional.</p>

<h4>
<a name="the-date-header" class="anchor" href="#the-date-header"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The date Header</h4>

<p>Dates should be specified in the full ISO 8601 standard, including
time zone offset, e.g. 2013-11-22T23:11:21-0400.</p>

<h3>
<a name="body-lines" class="anchor" href="#body-lines"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Body Lines</h3>

<p>A body line is one '%' character followed by at least one -, followed
by a space, followed by arbitrary text.</p>

<p>Exception: for an empty body line, the space is optional.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>%- This is a body line.
</code></pre>

<pre><code>%-- And so is *this*.
</code></pre>

<pre><code>%- and this next body line
%-
%- is empty, so doesn't need a space, but could have one.
</code></pre>

<p>A body line must always follow a header line or another body line.</p>

<h3>
<a name="threads" class="anchor" href="#threads"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Threads</h3>

<p>A thread is one or more adjacent comments, properly threaded.</p>

<p>For example, this is a thread:</p>

<pre><code>%* author: ejorgensen
%- I'm a one comment thread.
</code></pre>

<p>And so is this:</p>

<pre><code>%* author: ejorgensen
%- I'm a two comment thread.
%* author: bsmith
%- With no replies, just two top level comments.
</code></pre>

<p>And so is this:</p>

<pre><code>%* author: ejorgensen
%- I'm a two comment thread.
%** author: bsmith
%-- With a reply.
</code></pre>

<p>To be explicit: the nesting / reply level of a thread is determined by
the number of '*' characters in each header line / '-' characters in
each body line, which should remain constant for a given comment.</p>

<p>A comment that is a reply to a previous comment should have one more
'*' at the beginning of each header line and one more '-' at the
beginning of each body line than its parent comment.</p>

<p>The parent comment for any reply can always be determined by finding
the closest previous comment with one less level of nesting.  For
example:</p>

<pre><code>%* author: ejorgensen
%- I'm a top-level comment.
%** author: bsmith
%-- And I'm a reply.
%*** author: sjones
%--- And I'm a reply to the reply.
%** author: jkidd
%-- And I'm a second reply to the original top-level comment.
%* author: mdarks
%- And I'm another top-level comment.
%** author: lbutterman
%-- And I'm a reply to the second top-level comment.
</code></pre>

<h4>
<a name="position--target-of-threads" class="anchor" href="#position--target-of-threads"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Position / Target of Threads</h4>

<p>Diffscuss threads are generally taken to apply to the line immediately
above them, so for example in this snippet:</p>

<pre><code>+It's only just a test
%* author: ejorgensen
%- I have grave doubts about this change.  To me it appears foolhardy
%- and dangerous.
</code></pre>

<p>The comment applies to the line</p>

<pre><code>+It's only just a test
</code></pre>

<p>A Diffscuss thread can also appear directly after the range
information in a hunk, in which case the target of the comment is
assumed to be the entire hunk, for example:</p>

<pre><code>--- 1.txt   2013-03-07 20:18:10.000000000 -0500
+++ 2.txt   2013-03-07 20:18:35.000000000 -0500

%- I love this hunk.
 This is a test.

-It's just a test
+It's only just a test
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, if a thread appears at the very top of the Diffscuss file,
the thread applies to the whole changeset (where it should generally
act as a thread discussing the review as a whole--for example,
introductory remarks about what the changes are attempting to achieve,
"ship it" remarks, etc.).</p>

<p>Every Diffscuss file must begin with such a changeset level thread
(optionally preceded by any number of "magic" comment lines, e.g. "#
-*- coding: utf-8 -*-").</p>
